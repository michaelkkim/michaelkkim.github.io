I am currently a 3rd year statistics PhD student at the University of Florida. I'll formally start doing research Fall 2019, advised by Dr. Michael Daniels.

Before grad school, I did my undergrad at UNC Chapel Hill and majored in statistics and mathematics. My undergrad research consisted of performing network visualization and analysis on the citation network of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). I also did some NLP, clustering, and dimensionality reduction on SCOTUS text data.
